## Atomic Habits

    * Give your habit a time and place (eg - I will do push ups after waking up beside my bed)
    * Use Habit Stacking - Add a new habit just after your current habit. (eg - After I return from office, I will cook for me)
    * Design your environment to help you easily see the cues to good habits, (wanna read before bed, keep the book beside bed)

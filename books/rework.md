## Rework

This book has very tiny straight actionable items, which can help anyone who is trying to setup their business.

Every Chapter is awesome & I will always turn back to this book for future decisions, but few important points which were more relevent to me or stuck with me as of now are:

* Planning is guessing - You should plan for next day or week not for a year or 6 months, that is just like guessing when you are starting, you are tyring to predict things which are not in your control.
* Inspiration is a NOW thing, do it when it comes, you will be motivated for this, it will go away if you park it.
* You need less than you think.
* Focus on what won't change in the coming decade and solve that.
* Meetings & Intruptions a BIG NO, they will kill productivity.
* Quick wins is what you should target.
* Say NO by default.
* Be Real, show people behind the scenes.
* Cover Letter > Resume
* ASAP is the poison.
* Start the product from the epicenter, build the core first, other stuff can wait.
* Don't be a hero :D

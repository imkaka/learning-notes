### How to seek feedback!

You SHOULD actively try to receive feedback.

But, "Do you have any feedback for me?" won't get you feedback.

90% of the time, you'll hear: "Nope. No feedback from me."

The reason: The question isn't clear. Feedback on what exactly?

There's a lot of better ways to ask and actually get feedback:

* How would you have handled this particular situation?
* Do you think I could have handled this situation differently?
* Have you noticed something I'm doing that's slowing me or the team down?
* Is there anything I've done recently I should not be doing?
* What are few items you want me to do apart from the regular work in next 3-6 months which can help the team and me grow?


This is just a short list of more effective ways to get feedback.

In short, be specific with what you're asking. It will get you much farther.
